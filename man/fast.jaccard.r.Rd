\title{Shared nearest neighbors via fast Jaccard index calculation}
\usage{
fast.jaccard.r(.adj.matrix, .prune = 1/15)
}
\arguments{
\item{.adj.matrix}{A non-symmetric sparse adjacency matrix from \code{get.adj.matrix}, where
entry (j,i)=1 indicates j is among i's nearest neighbors (neighbors in rows, cells in columns).}

\item{.prune}{A numeric threshold (default 1/15 ≈ 0.067) for pruning weak edges. Jaccard
values below this are set to zero for sparsity.}
}
\value{
A symmetric sparse matrix of Jaccard indices representing the SNN graph. Higher values
indicate greater neighbor overlap. Entry (i,j) gives the Jaccard similarity between cell i
and cell j based on their shared k-nearest neighbors. Matrix is pruned to remove weak
connections and forced symmetric.
}
\description{
Computes a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph by calculating Jaccard similarity between
cells based on their k-nearest neighbors. The Jaccard index J(A,B) = |A∩B| / |A∪B| measures
the overlap of neighbor sets. This implementation uses sparse matrix operations for efficiency.
