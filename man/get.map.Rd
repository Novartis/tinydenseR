get.map(
  .lm.obj,

}
\arguments{
\item{.lm.obj}{A tinydenseR object with \code{$graph} component populated by \code{get.graph}.}

\item{.ref.obj}{Optional Symphony reference object for cell type annotation. Must have
\code{Z_corr} field (harmony-corrected embeddings) and metadata with cell type labels.
Only compatible with RNA assays. Replaces any existing \code{$graph$celltyping}.}

\item{.celltype.col.name}{Column name in \code{.ref.obj$meta_data} containing cell type labels
(default "cell_type"). Only relevant when \code{.ref.obj} is provided.}

\item{.cl.ct.to.ign}{Optional cluster or cell type name to exclude from downstream statistics.
Use for biologically irrelevant populations (e.g., erythrocytes in PBMC, which likely
represent technical artifacts). Cells in this population are mapped but excluded from density
calculations. Only one value allowed; merge multiple populations first via \code{celltyping}.}

\item{.verbose}{Logical for progress messages (default TRUE).}

\item{.seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility (default 123).}
}
\value{
Updated \code{.lm.obj} with \code{$map} component containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{fdens}: Matrix of fuzzy graph densities (landmarks × samples). Each entry is
the sum of cell-landmark edge weights for that sample, normalized by sample size and
excluding ignored populations.
\item \code{clustering$ids}: List of named character vectors (one per sample) with cluster
assignments for all cells.
\item \code{clustering$cell.count}: Matrix (samples × clusters) of cell counts per cluster
per sample. Used for "traditional" compositional statistics.
\item \code{clustering$cell.perc}: Matrix (samples × clusters) of percentage of cells per
cluster per sample. Used for "traditional" compositional statistics.
\item \code{celltyping$ids}: List of named character vectors (one per sample) with cell type
assignments (only if celltyping available or \code{.ref.obj} provided).
\item \code{celltyping$cell.count}: Matrix (samples × cell types) of cell counts per cell type
per sample. Used for "traditional" compositional statistics.
\item \code{celltyping$cell.perc}: Matrix (samples × cell types) of percentage of cells per
cell type per sample. Used for "traditional" compositional statistics.
\item \code{nearest.landmarks}: List of matrices (one per sample) with nearest landmark indices
for all cells from UMAP transform.
\item \code{cl.ct.to.ign}: Character value recording which cluster/cell type was excluded
from statistics (NULL if none).
}
If \code{.ref.obj} provided, also updates \code{$graph$celltyping} with list containing \code{$ids}
(factor of cell type assignments for landmarks), \code{$median.exprs} (matrix of mean expression
per cell type), and \code{$pheatmap} (heatmap object).
}
\description{
Projects all cells onto the landmark graph to compute fuzzy graph edge weights between cells and landmarks.
In addition, transfers cluster/cell type labels from landmarks to all cells.
}
\details{
\strong{Workflow Overview:}

For each sample, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Loads expression data and normalizes (size factors for RNA, marker subset for cytometry)
\item Projects to PCA/Harmony space (matching landmark processing)
\item Uses landmark UMAP model to compute fuzzy graph (cell-landmark edge weights) and find nearest landmarks
\item Assigns clusters/cell types by nearest landmark
\item Aggregates fuzzy graph edge weights into landmark densities per sample
}

\strong{Reference-Based Cell Typing:}

When \code{.ref.obj} is provided:
\itemize{
\item Expression is mapped to reference via Symphony
\item Cell types assigned by nearest neighbor in reference embedding
\item Landmark cell types updated and used for visualization/statistics
\item Replaces any existing manual cell type annotations
}

\strong{Fuzzy Graph Densities:}

The \code{fdens} matrix quantifies how strongly each landmark is connected to cells in each
sample. High values indicate the landmark's neighborhood is enriched in that sample. This
forms the basis for differential abundance testing in \code{get.stats}.
